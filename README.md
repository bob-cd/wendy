# Wendy

## Bob's SO and the reference CLI.

Wendy is an `opinionated client` for Bob and takes care of the following tasks:
- Implement a full CLI to all of Bob's REST API with corresponding and semantic commands

#### TODO
- Read declarative file(s) and translate to REST API calls to Bob
- Plan and orchestrate builds:
    - Bob doesnt know of the order of execution of pipelines
    - Wendy reads the dependencies of a pipeline on other pipelines and schedules them accordingly
    - Trigger all of the upstream pipelines of a pipeline such that Bob can proceed with the builds
- More?

Wendy is a reference client for Bob implementing a build with certain opinions but others are encouraged to build their own CLIs using Bob as an engine in ways they see fit.

Wendy follows the same spec-first approach like Bob, bootstrapping from the OpenAPI spec.
