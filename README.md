She is an `opinionated client` for Bob and takes care of the following tasks:

- Implement a full CLI to all of Bob's REST API with corresponding and semantic commands
- Read a `build.json` file and translate to REST API calls to Bob
- Plan a build:
    - Bob doesnt know of the order of execution of pipelines
    - Wendy reads the dependencies of a pipeline on other pipelines and schedules them accordingly
    - Trigger all of the upstream pipelines of a pipeline such that Bob can proceed with the builds

Wendy is a reference client for Bob implementing a build with certain opinions but others are
encouraged to build their own CLIs using Bob as an engine in ways they see fit.

**This is a work in progress in conjunction with Bob and will be evolving.**

## Building and running from source

### Requirements:
- [Graal VM](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/)
- [Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)(faster).
- A running instance of [Bob](https://github.com/bob-cd/bob)

### Running

Installing GraalVM:
- Download and extract GraalVM CE. Go to the extracted location and navigate to
  the directory where you can find bin, lib, jre and other directories.
- Run `export GRAALVM_HOME=$PWD`.

Clone the repo and from the repo directory:
- Run `clojure -A:test -m kaocha.runner` if using Clojure CLI.
- Run `$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/gu install native-image` to get the Graal native compiler.
- Run `clojure -A:native-image` if using Clojure CLI to compile it to a native executable.
  (Warning: Quite a resource heavy step)
- The executable is found at `target/wendy`.
- Running `./wendy health-check` should output `"Yes we can! ðŸ”¨ ðŸ”¨"`

#### The full command reference can be found [here](https://github.com/bob-cd/wendy/blob/master/docs/commands.md)

#### Configuration
You can configure Wendy in `~/.wendy.edn`. When you create a `~/.wendy.edn`-file then it currently has to hold all the configuration. That means it needs to have following map:
```
{:connection {:host "127.0.0.1"
              :port 7777}}
```
Here you can configure where your bob runs. Only Host and Port are possible for now.
